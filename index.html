                        <h3>Role</h3>
                        <p>Was solely responsible for everything IT related. Literally everything.<br>
                        Feeling cute. Might delete later.</p>
                        <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
                        <p>1. Developed voting system for deputies of city council. Unlike anything on the market, it would cost council nothing. All you need to vote is a smartphone (Do you guys not have phones?) or laptop. It was decided that buying remote controls with three buttons is better. </p>
                        <p>2. Maintained system used for registration of residence in local Center of administrative services. </p>
                        <p>3. Developed touristic Telegram-bot for city. 2020 definitely wasn't the year to launch touristic bot, but who could know. </p>
                        <p>4. In 2016 I was The Man who saved Christmas. Treasury, virus Petya, end of the year, salaries, you know the story. Me and a few good men had to restore all computer infrastructure in local treasury. And we did. </p>
                        <h3>Irrelevant Experience</h3>
                        <p>In recent months, it has become popular in Ostroh to say that you were on the Cultural Barbican project team, even if you were not there. However, those who really were with me at the origins of the idea surely will tell real story. This project taught me, that there is no impossible. You just need a team of people as obsessed with idea, as you are. In 2018 a bunch of people transformed old ruins into beautiful touristic attraction.</p>
